<h2 id=ppl>PPL Insider Scoop</h2>
<p>
Favourite - Rob Godmon @ 6/1; though he had what can only be described as an absolutely disaster class of a season last year, you cannot look past three time PPL winner Robert Michael Grafitti Godmon.
<br>
<br>
Yep the 3 x champ is our pick for the title this year, as he desperately tries to cover up his abysmal season where he went on to lose twice to Dinamo Muss,  AND was knocked out of the cup
<br>
<br>
This year however. It is different.
<br>
<br>
Spending his whole work day setting up the league(s), the bet(s) and now his team it would be a shocking error for me to look anywhere past this slightly on the spectrum manager - backing him to go all the way in the prem blowing the likes of David Norris and Jason Lavender out of the water
<br>
<br>
THECKSTONS THOUGHT: Stop living in the past mate, all you told us last year was that you had ‘Trio Tituli’ but with nothing to show this year you’ve gotta stop revelling in history and look to the FUTURE
<br>
<br>
Surprise Package: sighs no one WANTS this but I have to write it… our pick for the outside for the PPL is the living and breathing wank stain James Hodgson @ 10/1.
<br>
<br>
Does he live overseas? Yes
Doesn’t that mean he’s 6 hours behind us? Absolutely
Does he live and breath football like a true fan, even over there? You got it
Is he a massive fucking cunt? Truest one of the lot.
<br>
<br>
Look to say that Hodgson is an outsider is an outside shot in itself, but even though he has SOOOO MANY THINGS going against him I can see him having a chance at shocking the world and winning the PPL for the first time. As runner up of the Ramswalk cup and as a newly promoted team you can see the passion for the game has returned to this Brit-turned-yank and if you like shockingly good odds I’d say get ya money on Hodgson.</p>

<h2 id="segunda">Segunda Insider Scoop</h2>
<p>
  Yep as part of Bobbybets odds on this season we’re also dishing out some betting tricks and tips as to who we think is going up, who’s an outsider, and which team could SHOCK THE WORLD
<br>
<br>
Favourite: Johnny at 3/1 - no need for protection ladies, we’ve got all our hopes placed on this one Johnny. Hoping it doesn’t let us down.

For 8 long years Johnny Crane has been part of the PPL set up. With some top 4 finishes in the earlier years, Petr Cech Yourself looked a shoe in to win a PPL title and to become a stalwart in the league… however, since then disaster has struck and he’s found himself scrapping in the Segunda, a league that many people have gone into but not a lot can say they’ve managed to get out.

Until now.
<br>
<br>
Yep we’re backing big John to go all the way in this one, with him being given a VERY generous 3/1 it be silly not to throw your entire life savings at it, mainly because if he doesn’t come straight back up it could be the end for Johnny Crane and his team as we know it.

Dons tip for the player; Stop playing ‘Hipster fantasy football!’ John, we know you know a lot of football but there’s no need to be triple captaining your 4.5m defender just to try and prove a point to the lads. Stick it on Salah against Norwich and get out of that mick mouse division.
<br>
<br>
Outsider: @Ben Rush  at 11/2 - one of the players to catch my eye last year was Wiley little Ben Rush.

Being married and being a father to a young child was never gonna make his fantasy football season easy but with a big last minute push into the top 4 Mike Trashleys men were in dreamland.

Unfortunately due to the arrival of his second child it understandably derailed his season, as shown by him not setting his line up on the last day of the season. Crucial error but with two new small humans running around, you can hardly blame him.

Fast forward to this season, the man was the 4th person to join the Segunda when the code was given out - instantly showing his intent to do well in the league, I feel that you can’t look past anyone else but Ben to drop in and SHOCK THE WORLD.
<br>
<br>
Dons tip for the player; NEVER FORGET TO SET YOUR LINE UP.
<br>
<br>
Surprise package: @Josh Barlow @ 11/2 - low odds for the loud mouth from Blackburn, he’s shown he can talk the talk but this year I think he’s gonna walk the walk.

To make it to the quarter finals of the Ramswalk Cup is no mean feat. Even though he got blooted out by shockingly named ‘Team One’ we saw transfers and moves from
Barlow that would make you genuinely believe he is a title contender. Though it’s only his second season in the Segunda the amount of football this man watches he MUST have a good shout of getting into that top 3 spot.
<br>
<br>
So…If you fancy yourselves a tasty set of odds mixed with a man who’s got the temperament of a 50 year old coal minor who’s just had his job taken away from him by the Tories I’d put aside a coupla quid to Chuck on this lad.
<br>
<br>
Dons tip for the player; surprisingly much the same advice as I gave Johnny, stop playing your ‘absolute nailed on to start and score’
4.0 midfielder and then get angry when the poor 17 year old lad only gets 3 minutes at the end of a 4-0 defeat. GET LUKAKU IN AND GET HIM CAPTAINED.
